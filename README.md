# CircuitCourt

Order directly from local farmers, pick up your basket at the farm.
Training project for the **GitOps and CI/CD** module (Les Producteurs du Coin and Lambda Studio are fictional).

## Before the course

Do this at home **before the first day**, on your own computer (Linux, macOS or Windows). It takes about 30 minutes.

Then download the Docker images used during the course, so that the classroom network is not overloaded:

```bash
docker pull sonarqube:26.10.0.133078-community
docker pull myoung34/github-runner:2.338.0-ubuntu-noble
docker pull node:24
docker pull node:24-alpine
```

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev            # http://localhost:3000, restarts on every change
npm test               # unit and API tests (Vitest, Supertest)
npm run test:coverage  # the same, with the coverage report (coverage/)
npm run lint           # linter and formatter (Biome); npm run lint:fix fixes what it can
npm run build          # compiles the TypeScript into dist/
npm start              # runs the compiled version
```

`infra/` starts a GitHub Actions runner and a SonarQube server on your computer: copy `.env.example` to `.env`, fill it in, then `docker compose up -d` from `infra/`.
From TP 4 on, this runner also deploys the application "in production" on your computer, as described by `deploy/compose.yml`: http://localhost:8088.

## Training

The `TODO TP N` comments tell you what to do in each TP. At the end of each TP, the trainer publishes its solution as a branch (`tp-1` to `tp-6`).
Your measures (TP 5 and TP 6) go into `docs/measures.md`.

If your group is behind, catch up with the trainer's branch (here, TP 2), then merge the pull request.
All your files are replaced by the ones of the branch. From TP 4 on, put your GitHub id and your image tag back into `deploy/compose.yml`.

```bash
git fetch upstream
git switch -c catch-up-tp-2
git restore --source=upstream/tp-2 --staged --worktree .
npm install
git commit -m "chore: catch up with TP 2"
git push -u origin catch-up-tp-2
```
